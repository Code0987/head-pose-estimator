# Head pose estimation

This repo shows how to estimate human head pose from videos using TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- TensorFlow 1.4. It seems v1.12 also works.
- OpenCV 3.3 or higher.
- Python 3.5

The code is tested under Ubuntu 16.04.

### Installing

This repository comes with a pre-trained model for facial landmark detection. Just git clone than you are good to go.

```bash
# From the directory where you want to put this project:
git clone https://github.com/yinguobing/head-pose-estimation.git
```

### Running
The entrance file is `estimate_head_pose.py`. This will use your usb camera as the video source for demonstration.

```bash
# From the project directory, run:
python3 estimate_head_pose.py
```

You can change the video source to any video file that OpenCV supports.

## How it works

There are three major steps:

1. Face detection. A face detector is adopted to provide a face box containing a human face. Then the face box is expanded and transformed to a square to suit the needs of later steps.

2. Facial landmark detection. A custom trained facial landmark detector based on TensorFlow is responsible for output 68 facial landmarks.

3. Pose estimation. Once we got the 68 facial landmarks, a mutual PnP algorithms is adopted to calculate the pose.

The marks is detected frame by frame, which result in small variance between adjacent frames. This makes the pose unstable. A Kalman filter is used to solve this problem, you can draw the original pose to observe the difference.

The 3D model of face comes from OpenFace, you can find the original file [here](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/blob/master/lib/local/LandmarkDetector/model/pdms/In-the-wild_aligned_PDM_68.txt).

The build in face detector comes from OpenCV.
